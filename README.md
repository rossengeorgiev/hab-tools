hab-tools
=========

A bunch of scripts for high altitude ballooning

```
aprsnear-us.py - submits latest position of a callsign to spacenear.us (password and apikey required)
spot2habitat_chase.py - fetches SPOT position from feed and uploads it as chasecar in habitat
tinyburstmodel.py - calculates burst altitude based on balloon diameter and fill volume
```
